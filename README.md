# üéµ Vibrations ‚Äî Music-Based Matchmaking (Hub Repo)

Vibrations is a full-stack web application that connects people based on their **music preferences**.  
This is my **personal hub repository**: it summarizes the project, links all the team repositories, and highlights **my work on the Matchmaking Algorithm (AWS Lambda) and deployment**, along with **active contributions to the React frontend and Spotify integration**.

> Full technical details and documentation are in the [/docs](./docs) folder.

## üöÄ What the app does
- Users create a profile with:
  - Profile picture
  - Short bio
  - Top songs, artists, and genres
- Connects to **Spotify API** to fetch real listening data (or allows manual entry)
- Uses **geolocation** + user-chosen distance radius
- Finds nearby matches with similar music taste via a custom matchmaking algorithm
- Allows users to ‚Äúlike‚Äù profiles and connect when there‚Äôs mutual interest  
*(Supports both platonic and romantic connections)*

## üß± Architecture (High-Level)

  User-->UI[React SPA (NGINX)];
  UI-->API[Spring Boot REST API];
  API-->Auth[Cognito];
  API-->DB[RDS];
  API--invoke-->Lambda[Matchmaking Algorithm (Python)];

Frontend: React app served via NGINX on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Backend: Spring Boot REST API on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Matchmaking: Python algorithm deployed on AWS Lambda, invoked by backend

Auth & Storage: AWS Cognito (auth), AWS S3 (images), AWS RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)

üí° My Role
Main focus:

Designed and implemented the Matchmaking Algorithm

Scored matches based on overlap in artists, songs, and genres

Applied geolocation filtering using haversine distance formula

Tunable weighting for different similarity metrics

Deployed algorithm on AWS Lambda

Packaged Python handler, configured IAM roles and environment variables

Integrated Lambda invocation into Spring Boot backend

Active contributions:

React Frontend Development

Built match display components and UI elements for results

Integrated frontend with backend matchmaking API

Worked on CORS configuration and NGINX deployment

Spotify API Integration

Helped implement Spotify OAuth flow

Assisted in fetching and mapping user music data into profile schema
